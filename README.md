This is a simple web-based retail management system I developed (with some friends) for a class project.  It was written in the Groovy programming language and powered by the Grails platform.

We developed the web application before we mastered how to use Git.  My major contribution is the Product Manager module (wrote the Controller, Model and View) and tested it.
